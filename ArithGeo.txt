Arith Geo                                                                            
 Using the JavaScript language, have the function ArithGeo(arr) take the array of x`numbers stored in arr and return the string "Arithmetic" if the sequence follows  an arithmetic pattern or return "Geometric" if it follows a geometric pattern. If the sequence doesn't follow either pattern return -1. An arithmetic sequence is 
 one where the difference between each of the numbers is consistent, where as in a geometric sequence, each term after the first is multiplied by some constant or  
common ratio. Arithmetic example: [2, 4, 6, 8] and Geometric  example: [2, 6, 18, 54]. Negative numbers may be entered as parameters, 0 will not   be entered, and no array will contain all the same elements. 



Sol: 

 function ArithGeo(arr){
     var diff = arr[1] - arr[0];
     var div = arr[1] / arr[0];
     for(var i = 2;i<arr.length;i++){
          if ((arr[i+1] - arr[i]) == diff){
             return "Arithmetic";
           }
        else if((arr[i+1] / arr[i]) == div){
                 return "Geometric";
        }  else {
           return false; 
          }
        }
      }
